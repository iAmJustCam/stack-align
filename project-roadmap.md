# Healer Project Roadmap

## Overview
The Healer Project is designed to scan, identify, and automatically fix issues in modern web projects using React 19, Next.js 15, TypeScript 5, and Tailwind v4. This roadmap outlines the key improvements and features needed to enhance the system's functionality.

## Core Functionality Enhancements

### Phase 1: Fix Current Issues (High Priority)
- [x] Add code validation after transformations
- [x] Fix file naming transformation (kebab-case)
- [ ] Fix "use client" directive transformation
- [ ] Fix useEffect dependency array transformation 
- [ ] Fix named export transformation
- [ ] Enhance error handling for ts-morph operations
- [ ] Implement safety mechanisms to prevent syntax errors

### Phase 2: Transformation Robustness (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add pre-transformation validation to predict potential issues
- [ ] Improve complex transformation workflows with better error recovery
- [ ] Create specialized handlers for different file types (JSX, TSX, etc.)
- [ ] Implement incremental transformation with state tracking
- [ ] Add support for generating migration reports
- [ ] Create transformation rollback mechanism

### Phase 3: New Features and Integrations (Low Priority)
- [ ] Add support for batch processing multiple components
- [ ] Create a CLI interface for standalone usage
- [ ] Develop a VS Code extension for interactive healing
- [ ] Add integration with GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Support custom rulesets and configurations
- [ ] Create a web dashboard for project health metrics

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architectural Improvements
1. **Transformation Pipeline**: Replace the current direct approach with a multi-stage pipeline:
   - Stage 1: Analysis - Identify issues
   - Stage 2: Planning - Determine transformation order
   - Stage 3: Validation - Check for potential conflicts
   - Stage 4: Transformation - Apply changes
   - Stage 5: Verification - Validate results

2. **Core Module Enhancements**:
   - `component-healing-validator.ts`: Should be expanded to include both pre and post validation
   - `component-healer.ts`: Need to refactor for better testability and separation of concerns
   - Add new `transformation-pipeline.ts` to orchestrate transformations

3. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Implement more granular error handling with specific error types
   - Add logging system for transformation operations
   - Create recovery mechanisms for failed transformations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Create isolated tests for each transformation type
- Mock ts-morph interfaces for consistent testing
- Implement snapshot testing for transformation results

### Integration Testing
- Test full transformation pipeline with realistic components
- Test interactions between multiple transformations
- Test edge cases with malformed code

### Validation Testing
- Test validation logic with both valid and invalid code
- Create fuzzing tests to identify potential issues

## Documentation

### Developer Documentation
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Document common error scenarios and solutions
- Create contribution guidelines

### User Documentation
- Create user guide with examples
- Document common usage patterns
- Create troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Priorities
1. Fix core transformation issues (use client, exports, useEffect)
2. Implement validation improvements
3. Enhance error handling and recovery
4. Develop testing infrastructure
5. Create documentation

## Success Metrics
- All transformations pass validation tests
- System can handle at least 95% of common component patterns
- Error recovery works in at least 80% of edge cases
- Documentation covers all core functionality
